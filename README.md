CryptoPall is my personal and most important project, built with React.js, TypeScript, React Router, and Material UI. The app provides real-time cryptocurrency data, an intuitive dashboard with charts, and seamless portfolio management. It fetches live data from CoinGecko and integrates with Strapi for backend support. Key features include secure cryptocurrency purchases via custom hooks like useAuth and useBuyCoin. With a responsive design and modern UI/UX, CryptoPall ensures a smooth and secure user experience. This project is a reflection of my skills and passion for creating impactful applications.
